# About
This program tries to reconstruct the trajectory and position of a fireball given observer's data.

Program reads the data from a text file. The default is 'data.txt'. It can be overriden by passing a file name as an argument.

Output on current test data looks something like that:
```

# Compilation
```
$ git clone git@github.com:MaxVerevkin/fireball.git
$ cd fireball && make
```
Optionally, to enable parallelism (OpenMP), make with (remember to `make clean`):
```
$ make paralel
```
